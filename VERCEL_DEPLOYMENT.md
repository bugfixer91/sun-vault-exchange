# Vercel Deployment Guide for Sun Vault Exchange

## Prerequisites

1. Vercel account (sign up at https://vercel.com)
2. GitHub repository with the project code
3. Environment variables configured

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Connect GitHub Repository

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository: `sun-vault-exchange`
4. Select the repository and click "Import"

### 2. Configure Project Settings

#### Build Settings
- **Framework Preset**: Vite
- **Root Directory**: `./` (leave as default)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

#### Environment Variables
Add the following environment variables in Vercel dashboard:

```
VITE_CHAIN_ID=11155111
VITE_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID
VITE_INFURA_API_KEY=YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY
```

### 3. Deploy Configuration

#### Vercel Configuration File
Create `vercel.json` in project root:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev"
}
```

### 4. Domain Configuration

#### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to Project Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as instructed by Vercel
4. Wait for SSL certificate to be issued

#### Default Domain
- Vercel will provide a default domain: `https://sun-vault-exchange.vercel.app`
- This domain is immediately available after deployment

### 5. Environment-Specific Settings

#### Production Environment
- All environment variables are automatically available
- Build optimizations are enabled
- CDN distribution is active

#### Preview Environment
- Each branch gets its own preview URL
- Environment variables are inherited from production
- Perfect for testing before merging

### 6. Deployment Process

#### Automatic Deployment
1. Push code to `main` branch
2. Vercel automatically detects changes
3. Builds and deploys automatically
4. Sends deployment notifications

#### Manual Deployment
1. Go to project dashboard
2. Click "Deploy" button
3. Select branch to deploy
4. Monitor build logs

### 7. Post-Deployment Configuration

#### Analytics
1. Enable Vercel Analytics in project settings
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Track user interactions

#### Monitoring
1. Set up error tracking
2. Configure alerts for build failures
3. Monitor deployment status

### 8. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Build Failures**
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Review build logs for specific errors

**Environment Variables Not Working**
- Ensure variables start with `VITE_` for client-side access
- Redeploy after adding new variables
- Check variable names match exactly

**Wallet Connection Issues**
- Verify WalletConnect Project ID is correct
- Check RPC URL is accessible
- Ensure chain ID matches expected network

#### Performance Optimization
- Enable Vercel's Edge Functions for better performance
- Configure caching headers for static assets
- Use Vercel's Image Optimization for better loading

### 9. Security Considerations

#### Environment Variables
- Never commit sensitive keys to repository
- Use Vercel's environment variable encryption
- Rotate keys regularly

#### HTTPS
- Vercel provides automatic HTTPS
- Custom domains get SSL certificates
- Force HTTPS redirects are enabled by default

### 10. Maintenance

#### Regular Updates
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Update environment variables as needed

#### Backup Strategy
- Code is backed up in GitHub
- Environment variables are stored in Vercel
- Consider database backups if applicable
